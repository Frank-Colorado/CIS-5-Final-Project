# CIS-5-Final-Project

For my final project I decided to make a DND style campaign game. In this game, I make use of enums, structures, loops, conditionals, arrays, user input, functions, and pointer/references. I followed the instructions to make a fully working program using all the information we have learned throughout the class. I wrote many comments throughout the main.cpp file explaining all my thought processing and reasoning behind almost every line of code. In my demonstration video, I also explain things more in depth and played my game to show what it looks like. 

Here is a link to my demonstration video for this final project:
